# OSU CS340 Database Project

CRUD website for CS340.

https://cs340-db-project.herokuapp.com/

Each page of this website allows employees to insert and view entries for that page's table. In addition, orders can be updated, products can be searched, and coupons can be deleted - each of these functionalities can be done on their corresponding page.

The initial implementation of the website used MariaDB as its relational database management system. It was updated to use PostgreSQL so that it is compatible with Heroku's database system.
